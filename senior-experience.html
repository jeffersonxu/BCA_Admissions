		<p>The Academies focuses on developing students&#39; readiness for the workplace. To help students prepare for their professional futures, the Academies requires that each student in the 12th grade complete an internship program called <q>Senior Experience</q>.</p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>Senior Experience is a program in which students spend each Wednesday working in an internship at a company, office, laboratory, or other workplace. Each student identifies an area of interest and is placed accordingly to gain practical experience in their chosen field. A full-time faculty member coordinates and oversees the internships.</p>

		<p>The essential component of a successful internship is the student&#39;s active participation in an area of interest under the guidance of a mentor. Different mentors approach this in different ways. Some mentors design a special project specifically designed for the student to develop his/her skills. Others bring the student into an ongoing project. The internship may be in any discipline or involve any profession; however, it is mandatory that the student be an active participant in activities related to the field of study</p>
