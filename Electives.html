		<h1>Life of an Academy Students</h1>
	</div>

	<p>A typical school day starts at 8:00 a.m. with IGS (Informational Gathering Session). This is similar to homeroom. One big difference between the Academies and other schools is the length of the school day. School ends at 4:10 p.m., but if you choose to participate in a sport, the day may end even later.</p>

	<p>BCA classes are divided into modules, commonly called “mods,” that are approximately 17 minutes long. Classes are typically between 2-3 mods. Each day’s schedule is different: Monday schedules are similar to Thursdays and Tuesdays are similar to Fridays. Wednesdays are unique. All students take a 6-mod class called Projects except seniors who have internships.</p>

	<p>Each student has a certain amount of “free” mods. This is when they have no scheduled classes. They may choose to do their homework during their free mods or utilize the time to meet up with project partners or study with friends. </p>

	<p>The last hour of the day is dedicated to electives, or on Wednesdays, clubs. Students may participate in a sport instead of taking an elective. Students may also stay in school late to work on a project with a group or use materials only available in the school. There is a late bus at 6:30 p.m</p>
