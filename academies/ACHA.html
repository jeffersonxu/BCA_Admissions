			ACAHA students have a strong interest and passion for culinary arts as well as hospitality administration. This academy is ideal for those who would like to pursue a career in either field, or who are interested in the subject material and seek a well rounded high school experience that offers an honors-level core curriculum augmented by elective options in all facets of hospitality, management, customer service, entrepreneurship, and advanced culinary / pastry arts.</p>

			<p class = "description">Students train in a sophisticated culinary facility that rivals many professional restaurant sites. The curriculum includes foundations of hospitality and restaurant management. Electives in AP Micro and Macro Economics are emphasized. The course of study leads to certification from the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation, which can lead to hospitality scholarship opportunities. Articulation agreements with universities enable students to receive some college credit. For students interested in a career in hospitality management or the culinary arts, ACAHA offers the best possible preparation for college hospitality programs such as Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration.</p>
