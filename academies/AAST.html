			Students applying to the Academy for Science and Technology should have a passion for science and a curiosity to explore modern scientific questions through a comprehensive, hands-on curriculum. The AAST core curriculum incorporates classes taken with other BCA students while emphasizing its own academy focus. For example, AAST students take multiple years of biology, chemistry and physics together with AEDT students while completing studies in chemical engineering, microscopy, organic chemistry and modern physics particular to AAST. Graduates from AAST are prepared to continue studies across a wide range of scientific disciplines or to pursue areas such as medicine, law and public policy which will continue to be informed by the sciences as the 21st century progresses.</p>

			<p class = "description">The following are a few of the highlights included in the AAST curriculum:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>During the freshmen year, AAST students learn the theories and techniques necessary to complete real-world investigations in nanotechnology, biotechnology, chemistry, microscopy and optics.</li>
				<li>AAST sophomores explore the practical and environmental considerations involved in scaling experiments from the small classroom laboratory to the large industrial production plant.</li>
				<li>During the freshmen year, AAST students learn the theories and techniques necessary to complete real-world investigations in nanotechnology, biotechnology, chemistry, microscopy and optics.</li>
				<li>Junior and Senior students extend their theoretical knowledge and laboratory skills to the study of organic chemistry and can choose among several AP or IB science electives. Throughout the curriculum, students are encouraged to find original answers to modern research challenges using the stateof-the-art facilities available on campus.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class = "description">Many of the AAST faculty have years of industrial experience and several hold doctorates in their area of expertise. Additionally, through our Senior Experience program and other industrial or academic collaborations, AAST students have several opportunities to interact with outside experts from institutions including Columbia, BASF, Princeton, Stevens and the American Museum of Natural History to name just a few. Whether they pursue further science or choose another path, AAST graduates possess the knowledge, skills and experience to succeed in a number of fields.</p>
