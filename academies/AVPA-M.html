			<p>Students in the Academy for Visual and Performing Arts - Music (AVPA-M) have an outstanding ability in music and are the strongest musicians in their communities. Students in this program study an academic, honors-level college preparatory curriculum with a focus in music</p>

			<p>Ninth graders begin the program by enhancing their keyboard / piano skills in Digital Keyboarding. They also take Musicianship. In this exciting methods course, students learn woodwind, brass, string and percussion instruments. Conducting is also an important part of the course, as is rhythm dictation and score reading/interpretation. The course ends with a special project in the music technology field.</p>

			<p>Tenth graders learn current technological and compositional techniques in Electronic Music Synthesis. Students work with state-of-the-art software such as Finale and Pro Tools. The course culminates with each student completing a formal composition. The AVPA-M program ensures a rounded arts education with Music and Society: a course that teaches the evolution of the style with the corresponding art and sociopolitical trends.</p>

			<p>In eleventh grade, students take a rigorous AP course in music theory and may earn college credit: AP (Advanced Placement) Music Theory in the Digital Age. They study music theory at the college-level, including harmonic analysis, counterpoint, voice leading and ear training. An exhibition of students’ digital compositions is also part of the curriculum.</p>

			<p>In twelfth grade, students go beyond the AP theory curriculum in Advanced Problems in Music Theory & Technology. Here, students delve into augmented sixth and Neapolitan chords, fugal composition techniques, and analysis of twentiethcentury music. Twelfth graders complete the program with Senior Music and Media Seminar, where they present a lecturerecital or build a musical instrument!</p>

			<p>Finally, each AVPA-M student is required to participate in 2 trimesters of a performing music course each year (band, orchestra, choir or ensemble). The AVPA-M program is not a conservatory or a full-time performing arts program- we offer a college preparatory, academic honors program, with a focus in music.</p>
