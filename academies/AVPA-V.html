			<p>The visual arts concentration is a college preparatory program specializing in the latest advances in the arts, including 2D and 3D animation, print/digital publishing, and multi-media. Students study every essential aspect of the visual arts field through immersion in a curriculum that embraces these new technologies, while still emphasizing traditional skills and principles of art and design. While blending art and technology, students have the freedom to explore their strongest interests. Some of the latest areas of research include development with Maya 3D modeling software, Unity game development software, Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets, and Arduino programming to create immersive, virtual reality experiences in conjunction with Ellis Island and the National Parks Service.</p>

			<p>The curriculum is driven by computer graphics instruction and imaging technologies. Core classes specifically designed for Visual Students include an introduction to visual arts and graphic communication, design and production techniques, publishing, and digital imaging. Students are required to build and maintain a portfolio that exhibits a high degree of creativity as well as technical proficiency. Works in the portfolio range from traditional drawing and painting to photography, print and web design, computer animation and gaming, and video. Students have access to internships in literally hundreds of production houses that support the art and imaging needs of prestigious metro area businesses. They also have the opportunity to achieve certification with Adobe software, including InDesign, PhotoShop, Illustrator, Flash, Dreamweaver, and Premiere.</p>

			<p>The admissions process includes a portfolio review. We want to see where students’ interests lie and get a feel about how passionate they are about their art. All types of art are acceptable, both traditional and non-traditional, from paintings, drawings, and sculpture, to computer graphics, animation, web development, photography, video, etc.</p>
