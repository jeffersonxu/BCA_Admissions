			This program is ideal for students who have a strong interest in technology and computer science. The Academy for Technology and Computer Science offers a curriculum that focuses on computer architecture, computer programming, computer technologies, and networking. Partnerships with leading corporations such as Dell, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM give our students access to curricular resources that other schools cannot approach. ATCS prepares students for industry certifications, including Microsoft and Java. Students may also qualify for advanced placement in college by enrolling in the AP Computer Science course as well as other courses such as data structures.</p>

			<p>Because of their strong backgrounds in computer science, ATCS students have competed successfully in the following programming competitions: The IBM Mainframe Contest, The International Computer Science Olympiad, the New Jersey Institute of Technology Programming Competition, the Oracle Programming Competition, the Future Business Leaders of America Competition, and the American Computer Science League. An ATCS student will be well prepared for a college major such as computer science, computer engineering, or information systems.</p>

			<p>ATCS students who decide not to pursue computer-related careers in the future will find that the technical skills they have acquired through the academy’s curriculum will prove to be useful in a number of other fields.</p>
